                <h1>About myself</h1>
                <p>
                    I am Mian Azam Mehmood, a 22 years-old Pakistani citizen. I have been in Canada since August 2021. I
                    am
                    currently taking a post-secondary diploma in Software Development at Manitoba Institute of trades
                    and
                    technology. Beside studying full-time, I am working part-time as a “Night Auditor” at Canad Inns
                    destination center Fort Garry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving on to my education, I completed my secondary and higher secondary education from WAPDA Cadet
                    college Tarbela. Later on I moved to Winnipeg Canada and started
                    studying
                    BSc. Applied Computer Science-Information Systems at University of Winnipeg. After completing a year
                    there, I paused my degree and switched to MITT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to study software development at MITT because it will lead me to make my life plan or should
                    I
                    say business plan turn into reality. I will make most out of this course, learn skills and practical
                    knowledge, will join software industry, and beside of polishing my development skills, will also
                    learn
                    how things work in a software company, after all this, eventually I will start my own software house
                    back in my home country. In this advanced technological World, we continuously and regularly
                    interact
                    with websites and software. Developing all these commonly used things and making them work will keep
                    me
                    moving in this field.
